# Project: Building a Video Game Discovery App:

### Setting up project:

- Using vite version 4.1.0.
- Setting git repository at: https://github.com/syth09/Video-Game-Discovery-App.git

### Installing Chakra:

- Because we're using Vite so will install the library as guide in the chakra page:https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/vite-guide

* 1. Installation: `npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion`
* 2. Provider Setup:

```
import * as React from 'react'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

### Creating a Responsive Layout:

- Using the `Grid` components from chakra to create a responsive layout throughout our application.
- The `Grid` components from chakra also work exactly like `HTML grid`

```
import { Grid } from "@chakra-ui/react";

function App() {
  return <Grid templateAreas={}></Grid>;
}

export default App;
```

- After adding the `Grid` we set a `templateAreas` to define the layout of our `Grid` and then we add the `GridItem` inside our `Grid` to map it's location/area of display on our screen:

```
function App() {
  return (
    <Grid templateAreas={`"nav nav" "aside main"`}>
      <GridItem area="nav" bg="coral">
        Nav
      </GridItem>
      <GridItem area="aside" bg="gold">
        Aside
      </GridItem>
      <GridItem area="main" bg="dodgerblue">
        Main
      </GridItem>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

- To make it more user-friendly we would had to hide the `side panel` on mobile devices, so back to our `App` components instead of setting the `templateAreas` to a `String`, we should set it to an object and inside that object we can set various properties like: `base`, `sm` (small), `md` (medium), `lg`(large), `xl` (extra large), etc. These are our break points.

- Next, within our object we'd needed to define 2 different layouts, one for mobile devices and other for large devices with screen wider than 1024px. Now, after defining the layout we need to make sure the our `side panel` only shown when the layout of the user screen are `lg` or bigger, and with that we going to use the `Show` components and `above` methods from chakra.

```
function App() {
  return (
    <Grid
      templateAreas={{
        base: `"nav" " main"`,
        lg: `"nav nav" "aside main"`
      }}
    >
      <GridItem area="nav" bg="coral">
        Nav
      </GridItem>
      <Show above="lg">
        <GridItem area="aside" bg="gold">
          Aside
        </GridItem>
      </Show>
      <GridItem area="main" bg="dodgerblue">
        Main
      </GridItem>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```
